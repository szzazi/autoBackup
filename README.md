# autoBackup.sh

A lightweight, configurable Bash script to automatically back up system and user configuration data to a Samba (CIFS) network share.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Backup specific folders (e.g., `/etc`, `~/.config`)
- 🔒 Exclude sensitive or regenerable files
- 🛠 Configurable via interactive `install.sh`
- 🧪 Dry-run mode to safely simulate backups
- ⏱️ Scheduled execution via `cron`
- ✅ Samba mount and connection verification
- 🔧 Reconfigurable anytime

## 🔧 Quick Setup (copy & paste)

To install everything into `/usr/local/bin/autoBackup`, run:

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/autoBackup
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/autoBackup
git clone git@github.com:szzazi/autoBackup.git /usr/local/bin/autoBackup
cd /usr/local/bin/autoBackup
chmod +x configure.sh startBackup.sh
./configure.sh
```

> This will clone the full repository and launch the interactive installer.

---

## 📦 Configuration

Clone or copy the `autoBackup` folder somewhere or use the Quick Setup, then run:

```bash
chmod +x configure.sh
./configure.sh
```

The installer will:

1. Check for required packages: `rsync`, `zip`, `cifs-utils`
2. Prompt for settings (backup paths, Samba server, credentials, etc.)
3. Save them to `config.conf` with secure permissions
4. Test your Samba mount connection
5. Create sample `sourceList.txt` and `excludeList.txt`
6. Offer to set up a scheduled `cron` job

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings are stored in `config.conf`. You can edit it manually or re-run:

```bash
./configure.sh
```

### Example config (simplified):

```bash
PROGRAM_DIR="/usr/local/bin/autoBackup"
SOURCE_DIRS_LIST="$PROGRAM_DIR/sourceList.txt"
EXCLUDE_LIST="$PROGRAM_DIR/excludeList.txt"
SAMBA_SERVER="192.168.1.10"
SAMBA_FOLDER="/backupTarget"
SAMBA_VERSION="1.0"
SAMBA_USERNAME="backupuser"
SAMBA_PASSWORD="mypassword"
```

Configuration option to run sync-only by default

- `SYNC_ONLY_DEFAULT` in `config.conf` controls whether the script runs in sync-only mode when no CLI `--sync-only` flag is given.
- Valid values: `"true"` or `"false"`.
- The installer (`configure.sh`) prompts for this setting during configuration.
- CLI `--sync-only` always overrides the config value for a single run.

Example config snippet:

```bash
SYNC_ONLY_DEFAULT="false"   # set to "true" to make the script run sync-only by default
```

---

## 🧪 Dry Run Mode

You can test the backup process without writing any files:

```bash
./startBackup.sh --dry-run
```

This will:
- Generate an empty zip file
- Simulate `rsync` to remote target
- Mount/unmount network share safely

---

## 🕑 Scheduled Backups with Cron

The installer can add a `cron` job like:

```
06 01 */3 * * /usr/local/bin/autoBackup/startBackup.sh >>/var/log/autoBackup.log 2>&1
```

You can view your current crontab with:

```bash
crontab -l
```

Or remove the line manually if needed.

---

## 🧹 What Gets Backed Up?

By default, these folders are included (`sourceList.txt`):

- `/etc`
- `/home/youruser/.config`
- `/var/spool/cron`

And these are excluded (`excludeList.txt`):

- `.cache/`, `*.tmp`, `*.lock`, `*.bak`
- Trash folders, SSH private keys, X11 cookies, etc.

---

## 🗄️ Optional MySQL Database Backup

- The script can optionally back up MySQL databases and include them in the zip archive.
- The configurator (`configure.sh`) will prompt you to enable/disable MySQL backup and set all required parameters.
- Each table's data is exported to a separate file; schema and meta info are exported to one file per database.
- You can exclude system or unwanted databases (default: `mysql phpmyadmin`).
- All MySQL backup settings are stored in `config.conf` and can be edited manually.

### Example MySQL config section:
```bash
MYSQL_BACKUP_ENABLED="true"          # Enable/disable MySQL backup
MYSQL_USERNAME="backupuser"          # MySQL user
MYSQL_PASSWORD="yourStrongPassword"  # MySQL password
MYSQL_HOST="localhost"               # MySQL host
MYSQL_PORT="3306"                    # MySQL port
MYSQL_EXCLUDE_DBS="mysql phpmyadmin" # Excluded databases
```

**Required MySQL privileges for export:**

- `SELECT` (read table data)
- `SHOW VIEW` (read views)
- `EVENT` (read events)
- `LOCK TABLES` (for consistent dumps)

In dry-run mode, the script will check if the configured MySQL user has these privileges and report any missing rights before attempting a real backup.

If you set `MYSQL_BACKUP_ENABLED="false"`, no database backup will be performed.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- ✅ Make sure `rsync`, `zip`, and `cifs-utils` are installed.
- 🧪 Test the Samba connection with `install.sh`.
- 🔐 Ensure the Samba credentials are correct (config or CLI).
- 🔧 Log output is stored in `/var/log/autoBackup.log`.
- 🛑 Mount failures may be due to unsupported `vers=` on the server.

---

## ✅ Example Commands

Run a real backup:

```bash
./startBackup.sh
```

Run with custom credentials:

```bash
./startBackup.sh --user yourUser --pass yourSecretPass
```

Run in test mode:

```bash
./startBackup.sh --dry-run
```

Run only a Samba/CIFS connection test:

```bash
./startBackup.sh --test-samba
```

This will:
- Mount the configured Samba/CIFS network share
- Immediately unmount it
- Print connection test results
- Exit without performing any backup or file operations

Run only a sync to remote (no zip):

```bash
./startBackup.sh --sync-only /path/to/local/folder
```

If you omit the path, the script will read `SOURCE_DIRS_LIST` from `config.conf` and sync each path listed there:

```bash
./startBackup.sh --sync-only
```

Use `--dry-run` with `--sync-only` to simulate the sync operation.
